This unit is ideally to be completed as **prework** for this course, by the time of your start date. In the first lesson we provide review materials on HTML, CSS, command line, and Git. We then ask you to complete a simple coding challenge that demonstrates your mastery of this material. In the second lesson, we provide some introductory readings on the Python programming language and do some exercises on Python basics with strings, numbers, and datetime objects. We also introduce [Python Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans/wiki), which is a platform for learning about features of the Python language and testing at the same time. 

The goal of this lesson is to get you back into the programming mindset if you're not already there, and to ensure prerequisite knowledge that you need to have to succeed in this course. If you have made it through this lesson by your start date, you'll be able to hit the ground running and rapidly make progress.

**Goals**

*	Review and demonstrate mastery of HTML and CSS basics
*	Refresh on command line
*   Know how to use Python Koans to build your knowledge of Python
*   Familiarity with numbers, strings, and date time objects in Python.
