# Programming in Python Prework

This unit is ideally to be completed as **prework** for this course, by the time of your start date. In the first lesson we provide review materials on HTML, CSS, command line, and Git. We then ask you to complete a simple coding challenge that demonstrates your mastery of this material. In the second lesson, we provide some introductory readings on the Python programming language and do some exercises on Python basics with strings, numbers, and datetime objects.

The goal of this unit is to get you back into the programming mindset if you're not already there, and to ensure prerequisite knowledge that you need to have to succeed in this course. If you have made it through this unit by your start date, you'll be able to hit the ground running and rapidly make progress.

**Goals**

*	Review and demonstrate mastery of HTML, CSS, Git, Github, and command line basics
*   High level introduction to Python as a programming language
*   Familiarity with numbers, strings, and date time objects in Python
