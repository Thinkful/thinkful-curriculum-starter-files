# The Python Programming Language

Before we start learning about the details of different parts of the Python programming language, there are some higher level characteristics of the language that are good to understand. For this, we'd like you to read through the [General Introduction](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/GeneralIntro/introduction.html) to the *How to Think Like a Computer Scientist* online course.

This text will explain to you the difference between high- and low-level, and compiled and interpreted programming languages. You'll also learn about the two modes Python can be run in: the interactive console and program mode. 

### Comprehension Check:

1. Is Python a high- or low-level programming language? Explain what this distinction means.
2. What’s the difference between an interpreted and compiled language? Which one is Python?
3. Explain the two environments that Python code can be run in: shell mode vs. program mode.
4. What’s the ending for Python program names? 
5. What is a program?
6. What is debugging? 
7. What are syntax errors?
8. What’s a runtime error?
9. What’s a semantic error?
