# Python Basics at Codecademy

We're at the end of the prework unit for this course. To close things out, we're going to work through some simple exercises over at Codecademy that will teach you the basics of working with variables, numbers, strings, and datetime objects.

## Python Syntax 

Work through this set of exercises on [Python syntax basics](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-python-6WeG3/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096). You'll learn about some of Python's basic data types, arithmetic operations, commenting and indenting code, and variable assignment. The ideas you'll learn here are simple, but they are building blocks of all programs.

### Comprehension Check

1. What’s the difference between an integer and a float?
2. What are booleans?
3. What does indentation do in Python code?
4. How do you do exponentiation in Python?
5. In the context of arithmetic operations, what does the % operator do?
6. What does it mean to comment your code? How do you do this in Python?

## Working with Strings

Much of the programming you do in Python will require working with strings. Work through these [exercises on strings](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-sRXwR/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096) from Codecademy, which will introduce some of the methods shared by all string objects.

### Comprehension Check

1. What does it mean to escape a character in a string, and how do you do this in Python?
2. Give some examples of escaped characters.
3. What’s the difference between a variable and a value, and how do you declare (a.k.a., assign) a variable?
4. Given `my_string = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"` how would you return a lowercase version of my_string?
5. How would you assign the letter "G" from my_string to a new variable (say, x) using subscripting?
6. What is string concatenation and how do you do it?


## Datetime Objects

One of Python's more convenient built in objects is the datetime object. In [this set of exercises](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-en-zFPOx/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096), you'll learn how to work with dates and times in Python. 

### Comprehension Check

Using the datetime and % string formatting, how would you print a string of the current day in the form 12/22/2010?
