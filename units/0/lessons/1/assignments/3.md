# Web Basics Coding Challenge

You will need to implement this sketch as a single, static web page.


To complete this challenge, you must:

*	Achieve the layout indicated in the sketch. 
*	Users should be able to change X and Y and click the add or subtract button to see new results, without reloading the web page.
*	You should use Git and Github to save your app. When you've completed the challenge, please push your commit up to Github.com, create a GH-pages branch to host the page, and share a link to the repo and the GH page with your mentor, who will let you know if you've passed the challenge. If you need instructions on how to host static web pages using gh-pages branches, follow [this guide](https://pages.github.com/). To get the relevant instructions, select the "Project Site" and "Start from Scratch" options.
