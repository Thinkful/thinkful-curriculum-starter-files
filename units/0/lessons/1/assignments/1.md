## HTML & CSS
Much of Angular development involves reasoning about and creating UI components. This means being able to rapidly write (HTML & CSS) code based on sketches. Whether you ultimately plan to create your sketches or work with a designer, you should be able to break a sketch down into containers and content, and you should be able to write clean HTML and CSS to implement the sketch. When we start using partials, directives, and animation in this course, you'll need to already command HTML and CSS.

If you want a concise review of HTML and CSS fundamentals, we recommend:

*	[Advanced Guide to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/)


## Debugging with Developer Tools
To debug client side apps, you need a suite of developer tools. In this course, we'll use Google Chrome's aptly named *Developer Tools*. If you already know what all the panels in Developer Tools are for, that's a good sign that you'll do well in this course. For a refresher, we recommend the following resources:

*	[Discover DevTools](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/), a free course from Codeschool
*	[Official Docs](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/) from Google Developers on Chrome Dev Tools
