# Front End Basics

## HTML & CSS

In this course we won't spend a lot of time coding up complicated client side UIs, but we will be using Python and Flask to create web apps that will serve HTML and CSS. When we get to topics like templating and using Twitter Bootstrap, mastery of HTML and CSS basics will be critical because there will simply be too much to learn at once.

You do not need to be an advanced front end programmer, but you should be comfortable structuring content using HTML tags and styling it by creating CSS rules. You should be able to take a simple sketch of a front end interface and break it down into containers and content, and you should be able to write clean HTML and CSS to implement the sketch.

If you want a concise review of HTML and CSS fundamentals, we recommend:

## Debugging Web Pages on the Client Side

Although our focus in this class will be on the server side, when we're manually testing our web apps, we'll need to be able to inspect our compiled code. For this, we recommend Google Chrome's *Developer Tools*.  

To get up to speed on dev tools, consult the following resources:
