### Overview
This lesson provides review materials for all the prerequisites for this course. 

In the second half of this course, we'll be creating Python-driven web apps with Flask. To succeed at learning that material, you already need to have mastered HTML and CSS basics, so we'll touch on that topic in this lesson. 

When we're scripting in Python, working with Heroku, and using verison control in our projects, we'll be working from the command line, so we also provide resources to refresh on command line basics and Git and Github.

In the final assignment in this lesson, you'll be asked to code up a simple static web page based on a sketch we provide. You'll have to code up the page and then host this file on a Github.io page, which will demonstrate your mastery of all the course prerequisites.
