# Learning SQL with SQLite

In this first lesson, we'll get SQLite up and running, and then we'll get a crash course in SQL as we work through part of the online book [Learn SQL The Hard Way](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/). We'll learn how to use the command line interface to interact with SQLite databases, and create a small  sample database of pets, people, and pet shelters. We'll work with this database to learn the fundamentals of SQL: creating tables, inserting records, modifying and deleting them, and querying them.

### Goals
*   Install SQLite and learn how to work with it
*   Learn the basics of SQL
