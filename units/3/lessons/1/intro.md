name: Learning SQL with SQLite

type: intro

In this first lesson, we'll get SQLite up and running. SQLite is a lightweight and easy to configure database suitable for developing web apps. We'll learn how to use the command line interface to interact with SQLite databases, and create a small  sample database of pets, people, and pet shelters. We'll work with this database to learn the fundamentals of [SQL (structured query language)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL): creating tables, inserting records, modifying and deleting them, and querying them.

Keep in mind that the goal here is **not** to teach you everything about SQL. You could spend an entire course focusing only on relational databases. Instead, the goal is to teach you enough about SQL that you'll have a sense of what's happening "behind the scenes" later in this course when we begin to use SQLAlchemy as an abstraction layer over our databases.
