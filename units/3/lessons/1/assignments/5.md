In the previous assignment, we learned how to select, delete, and update data. In this short assignment, you'll get additional practice querying and updating records. 

Working with the same database you ended with in the previous assignment, write SQL statements to achieve the following: 

*   Select all the cats
*   Update all cats to set adopted to False
*   Select all the pets belonging to a specific person
*   Update all the cats belonging to a specific person to set adopted to True.

Each one of these requires only a single query.
