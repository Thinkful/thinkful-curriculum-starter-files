# SQL Crash Course Part 3: Altering Tables, Transactions, and Data Modeling

In the final installment of our SQL crash course, we're going to learn about altering tables, database transactions and data modeling. 


Part 3 - Foreign Key Constraints and the Cascade
------------------------------------------------
Read the book exercises 12, 14, and 15 and come back here 
(13 is an assignment that we'll be replacing with our own so you can skip it).
At this point you've got a pretty good grasp of the fundamentals of database
design and some of the issues we need to be aware of. You're also aware of
transactions, and the basics of normalization. 


Please work through the following exercises in *LSQLTHW*:

*   [Exercise 12: Selecting Data](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex12.html)
*   [Exercise 14: Select Across Many Tables](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex14.html)
*   [Exercise 15: Deleting Data](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex15.html)

We're skipping exercise 13 because it is incomplete. It covers migrating and evolving data, which is a critical SQL/database topic. We'll cover that topic in the next assignment.
