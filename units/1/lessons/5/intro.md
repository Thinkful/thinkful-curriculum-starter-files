# Object Oriented Programming in Python

In this lesson, weâ€™ll deal with objects, object oriented programming, and Python classes. We'll say a lot about what objects are in the course of this lesson, but for now, know that objects give us a way of modeling things and processes by allowing us to bundle together behaviors and properties into individual object instances. For instance, your neighbor's car could be modeled in software as an object with a weight property, wheels, maximum speed, length, etc. It also has behaviors, like breaking, accelerating, signaling, etc. Object oriented programming is an approach to modeling concrete things like cars as well as more abstract things like relations between businesses and customers, friends and colleagues, etc.

The material in this lesson will be the most difficult so far. The syntax for creating classes in Python is straightforward enough, but being able to reason well about using classes in object oriented programming requires understanding and practically using some challenging concepts like inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and encapsulation. 

If you're not familiar with these terms, don't worry. We'll explain these concepts and what you can do with them in this lesson, and you'll get a solid footing in Pythonic object oriented programming. And as we move to object oriented programming, we'll begin focusing more on software design and architecture decisions, as there becomes less and less new Python syntax to define and learn. 

You'll do several readings about object oriented programming in Python and do some exercises to get practice with Python's syntax for defining and instantiating classes. In the final assignment in this lesson, you'll be asked to use object oriented programming to model a real world situation, and you'll use your solution to the problem as a conversation piece with your mentor to think begin thinking about what makes good software design.
