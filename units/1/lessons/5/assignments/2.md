# Practice Functions
##### 60 minutes

You've seen several examples of functions at this point. Now get some practice with writing and using functions. 

Do all 19 exercises from the [Python functions track](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-c7VZg/0/1) at Codecademy.

Note that these exercises both create and import functions from existing modules. We'll discuss modules more in Unit 2 of this course.

## Comprehension Check

1. How do you import a module?
2. How do you import a specific function from a module?
3. What's the problem with universal imports?
