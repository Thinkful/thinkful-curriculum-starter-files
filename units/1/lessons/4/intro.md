# Functions

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn all about functions. Functions give you a way to group together and re-use pieces of code that accomplish a given task. You'll use functions in nearly every serious program you write, and they allow you to write reusable, clean, maintainable code.

We've already encountered some of Python's built in functions earlier in this unit. You can also define custom function in your Python programs, and you'll learn how to do that in this lesson.

We'll start off with a conceptual introduction to functions, then you'll complete some exercises over at Codecademy to get practice creating functions.

## Goals

- Conceptual understanding of functions
- Know how to write custom functions in Python
- Be able to break a problem down into functions that can be used to solve it
