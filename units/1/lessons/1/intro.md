#  Setting Up Your Development Environment

To complete the materials in the remainder of this course, your development environment will need to meet some minimal requirements that we'll take care of in this lesson. In addition to having Git configured and Sublime Text 3 installed, we'll walk you through installing Python 2.76, [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/), and [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) installed on the computer you'll be developing on. 

The process for setting up your dev environment will vary depending on the platform of your computer. We'll set you in the right direction for Mac, Windows, and Nitrous.io platforms. That last one is a cloud-based platform that we recommend in general and specifically for students who would otherwise face configuration headaches to get the requirements fulfilled on their computer. 


## Goals

*   Install and configure Python 2.76, virtualenv, and pip
*   Install Sublime Text plugins that will improve your work flow
*   Establish a safe and self documenting workflow for Git
