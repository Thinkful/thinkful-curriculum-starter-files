#  Sublime Text Setup

In the introduction to this course, we asked you to [install Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) if you don't already have a preferred text editor. In addition to being a great text editor out of the box, there are a large number of publicly-available plugins for Sublime Text that can improve and speed up your coding process. 

In this assigment, we're going to walk you through installing four of these plugins:

*   [Package Manager](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation) for managing your Sublime Text plugins
*   [Anaconda](https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda), which offers tab completion and [linting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) for Python files. 
*   [Emmet](https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime) which offers tab completion for HTML files.
*   [Sidebar Enhancements](https://github.com/titoBouzout/SideBarEnhancements), which expands the menu options when you right click on your file tree in the left panel of Sublime Text.

**NOTE:** If you're using Nitrous.io for your development platform in this class, you have two main options for writing your code. On the one hand, you can use the built in IDE in the Nitrous.io platform -- you can do everything you need to do for this course using it. On the other hand, you can take advantage of Nitrous.io's folder syncing feature to edit your Nitrous projects with a text editor on your local computer, and then have the changes you make sync with your Nitrous box. If you're a PC user, you can download the Nitrous.io desktop app [here](https://www.nitrous.io/desktop#windows), and you can learn how to edit your files locally [here](http://help.nitrous.io/nitrous-desktop-win/#file-sync).  If you're a PC user, you can download the Nitrous.io desktop app [here](https://www.nitrous.io/desktop#mac), and you can learn how to edit your files locally [here](http://help.nitrous.io/nitrous-desktop/#file-sync).


## Package Manager

The first plugin we need to install is Package Manager, which we'll then use to install the remainder of our plugins. Install Package Manager is easy enough: just follow the official instructions [here](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation#st3).

## Anaconda 

As we said, Anaconda adds tab completion, linting, and other features to make writing Python code more pleasant and productive in Sublime Text 3. 

## Emmet 


Let's install Emmet, which helps you with tab completion. For instance, when you’re working on an HTML file, you can simply type “!” followed by TAB, and you’ll automatically get this code:

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>

Another really helpful shortcut is lorem. When you type this and then hit tab, Emmet will generate lorem ipsum filler text that looks like this:

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Illum, quod, commodi vel iste qui consequuntur minus eligendi soluta delectus nihil consectetur quos dignissimos quibusdam deserunt sint optio neque placeat odit?

Designers commonly use lorem ipsum text when they don’t yet have the copy written for a particular section.

To install Emmet:

On Mac, do Cmd-Shift-P to get the Command Palette. On Windows, do Ctrl-Shift-P.
Inside of the Command Palette, type “Install package” and then select the Package Control: Install Package option
In the install package dialogue box, type in "emmet", then hit return. After Emmet installs, pay attention to the output. You may need to restart Sublime Text or change some setting, and this output will let you know.
After you’ve installed Emmet, take a look at the docs, and be sure to watch the short demo video at the top of the page. Also, have a look at this Emmet cheat sheet to get a sense of some of the useful shortcuts (in particular, be sure to look at the HTML shortcuts).
