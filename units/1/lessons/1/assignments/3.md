This will prevent you from accidentally committing files or changes you don't mean to commit. Never end a programming session without running `git status` to ensure that your repo is clean. 
-  **Use Feature Branches**: branch from clean master. push up to remote with tracking. if you're collaborating with others, merge master back in to your branch before merging back into master. delete feature branches when they've been merge

-  **Never Blindly Add Files**: 
-  **Don't Expose Private Information Publicly**: why how, if you need them in code.

These guidelines are minimal, and as you grow as a programmer, you'll
