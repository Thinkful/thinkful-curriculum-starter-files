#   Zero to Hello World: Setting Up Python

In this assignment, we'll walk you through getting Python 2.76, virtualenv, and pip installed and running on your computer. 

*   Python 2.76 is the most recent stable version of Python 2 as of the time of writing (April 2014). 
*   [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/virtualenv.html) is a tool for creating isolated Python environments and manage dependencies. 
*   [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/) is a package manager that makes it easy to install and track Python packages.

We'll outline the steps to take depending on if you're developing on Mac, Windows, or Nitrous.io (the cloud-based platform we recommend for students who don't otherwise have access to a computer that can support our requirements).
