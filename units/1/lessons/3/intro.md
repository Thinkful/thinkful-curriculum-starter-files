#   Python's Data Types

In the prework for this course, you got experience with Python syntax and some of the basic data types. In this lesson, you'll round out your knowledge of Python's primary data types. You'll learn more about working with strings; you'll learn about the special data type `none`, which is for representing the absence of a value. We'll then focus on Python's objects for handling collections of things: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. 

The Python language fundamentals taught in this lesson are worth memorizing sooner rather than later. Until these are second nature, you'll struggle to be an efficient Python programmer. 

<note>
If you missed the prework, the key things to do are:
- Read through the [General Introduction](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/GeneralIntro/introduction.html) of *How to Think Like a Computer Scientist* for a high level introduction to Python. 
- Work through these [exercises](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-python-6WeG3/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096), which introduce strings, numbers, arithmetic operations, commenting and indenting code, and variable assignment.
- Work through these [exercises](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-sRXwR/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096), which introduce commonly used methods all strings in Python have.
- Work through these [exercises](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-en-zFPOx/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096) to familiarize you with Python's built in datetime object, which simplifies converting and formatting dates and times.
