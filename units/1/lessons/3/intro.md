# Python's Data Types
##### 3 hours

In the warmup for this course, you got experience with Python syntax and some of the basic data types. In this lesson, you'll round out your knowledge of Python's primary data types. You'll learn more about working with strings; you'll learn about the special data type `none`, which is for representing the absence of a value. We'll then focus on Python's objects for handling collections of things: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. 

The Python language fundamentals taught in this lesson are worth memorizing sooner rather than later. Until these are second nature, you'll struggle to be an efficient Python programmer. 


## Goals

- Understand Python's basic data types
- Learn more about string formatting
- Learn how to represent and manipulate collections of things
