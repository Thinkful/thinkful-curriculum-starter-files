# First Look at Lists
##### 20 minutes

In the first assignment in this lesson, we got a brief introduction to lists. You will use lists again and again in your Python programs, so it's critical you understand how they work and some of the peculiarities of working with them.

Watch the video below from Khan Academy, which introduces lists in Python. Pay special attention to the section that discusses making copies of lists.

2. What's the syntax for creating a list?
3. How do you refer to the *n*th element in a list?
4. Can you assign a list as an item in a list?
5. Given `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = a`, what would `b[0]` evaluate to if we did `a[0] = 'cats'`? Why is this?
6. Given `a = [1, 2, 3]`, what would `b = a[:]` do? Why would we prefer this over `b = a`?
