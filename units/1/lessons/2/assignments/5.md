# Practice Lists and Dictionaries

Just reading about lists and dictionaries isn't going to make you master them. Let's get some practice with the syntax for lists and dictionaries and see how we can use them. 

Work through [this set of exercises from Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-en-pwmb1/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096). To be clear, you should work through all 14 exercises. Also, be aware that you'll see some conditional syntax that looks like this:

    if 1 < 2:
        print "do something"

Fortunately, Python is human readable, so you probably already guessed that `print do something` would print here because 1 is indeed less than 2. You'll also encounter *for loops* which allow you to iterate over each item in a list and do something with it. We'll cover both conditionals and loops in more depth when we get to the lesson on control flow later in this unit. 

## Comprehension Check

1. How would you assign a new value to the *n*th item in a list called 'my_list'?
2. How do you add an item to the end of a list?
3. How can you find out the length of a list?
4. What is list slicing? Give an example.
5. What does the .index() method do on lists?
6. How would you use .insert() method?
7. What does the .sort() method do?
8. What are key-value pairs? 
9. How do you add an item to a dictionary?
