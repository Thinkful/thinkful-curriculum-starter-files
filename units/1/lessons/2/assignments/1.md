# Basic Data Types

To be productive in a programming language, you need to have a clear understanding of the basic data types. This means knowing the syntax for working with them and their characteristics and behaviors, so be sure to memorize the concepts discussed in this reading and make them a part of your working mental map. 

none numbers boolean strings tuples lists sets dictionaries  / secondarily functions objects

**Simple Types**

- **none**
- **booleans**
- **strings**
- **numbers**

**Collections**

- **lists** pop push length, slice, index, copy
- **tuples** explain, but don't use for now. 
- **sets** explain, but don't use for now
- **dictionaries** key value relations, sorting keys, filtering by keys etc.

closing: mention operators, mention functions, mention objects

programming as being able to break processes, things, into these.
