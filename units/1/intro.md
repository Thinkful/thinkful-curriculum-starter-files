# Programming Basics in Python

In this unit, we're going to cover a lot of territory quickly. We'll configure our development environment, and then start ploughing through progamming fundamentals in Python. 

In the prework unit of this course, you already started working with strings, numbers, and date time objects. In this unit, you'll fill out your knowledge of Python basics. You'll learn about working with collections (lists, tuples, and dictionaries), control flow, functions, object oriented programming, file i/o, serialization, and debugging and logging.
