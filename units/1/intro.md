# Programming Basics in Python
##### 30 hours

In this unit we'll review the prerequisites you need to have to succeed in this course (basic HTML and CSS and Git and Command line basics), and then we'll move on to set up our development environment and then go on to learn programming fundamentals in Python. The concepts and language features we'll talk about form the building blocks of all your future programs, no matter what problem domain you're working with. And while understanding and memorizing the Python language features covered in this won't yet make you a good Python programmer, they will equip you with the tools you'll need to solve real world problems in almost any domain imaginable. 

In this unit, you'll fill out your knowledge of Python basics. You'll learn about data types, working with collections (lists, tuples, and dictionaries), control flow, functions, object oriented programming, file i/o, serialization, and debugging and logging. 
 
In the next unit, you'll start working on real world projects. This unit mainly focuses on background knowledge and drills to equip you for the real world projects you'll spend the rest of your life as a programmer tackling. That being said, it does contain some small projects that you'll code up that are geared toward consolidating your knowledge of programming fundamentals in Python. For instance, you'll write a [Fizz Buzz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) program, and at the end of the unit, you'll practice using object oriented programming to model a real world scenario.

The best advice we can give you about this unit is to master the skills it teaches as soon as possible. If there's a time to cram in this course, it's in this first unit. The first big hump you face as a Python programmer is learning these skills. But once you do, you'll be able to do much more than canned projects; you'll be able to apply programming to real world problems.

**Goals**

*   Brush up on HTML, CSS, command line, and Git/Github
*   Configure development environment 
*   Understand Python data types, how to work with collections of things, control flow, functions, objects and object oriented programming basics. 
*   Get experience breaking down a process into an executable set of instructions
