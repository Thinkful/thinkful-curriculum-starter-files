# Programming Basics in Python

In this unit, we're going to cover a lot of territory quickly. We'll configure our development environment, and then start ploughing through progamming fundamentals in Python. 

In the prework unit of this course, you already started working with strings, numbers, and date time objects. In this unit, you'll fill out your knowledge of Python basics. You'll learn about working with collections (lists, tuples, and dictionaries), control flow, functions, object oriented programming, file i/o, serialization, and debugging and logging. 

Memorization will only get you so far in programming, but the fundamentals we cover in this unit are the things that are worth memorizing about a new language. The topics covered in this unit represent the lowest level tools in Python, and to create programs with any degree of complexity, you'll need to master these basics. 

In the next unit, you'll start working on real world projects. This unit does contain several projects that you'll code up that are geared toward consolidating your knowledge of programming fundamentals in Python. Over the course of this unit, you'll write a Hot or Cold and a [Fizz Buzz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) program, and you'll refactor both of these as you learn about new Python basics.

**Goals**

*   Configure development environment 
*   Understand collections, control flow, functions, objects, file i/o, serialization, debugging, and logging in Python
*   Get experience breaking down a process into an executable set of instructions
