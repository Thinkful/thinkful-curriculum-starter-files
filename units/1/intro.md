# Programming Basics in Python

In this unit we'll set up our development environment and then go on to learn programming fundamentals in Python. The concepts and language features we'll talk about in this unit form the building blocks of all your future programs, not matter what problem domain you're working with. Although understanding and memorizing the Python language features covered in this won't yet make you a good Python programmer, they will equip you with the tools you'll need to solve real world problems in almost any domain imaginable. 

In the prework unit of this course, you already started working with strings, numbers, and date time objects. In this unit, you'll fill out your knowledge of Python basics. You'll learn about data types, working with collections (lists, tuples, and dictionaries), control flow, functions, object oriented programming, file i/o, serialization, and debugging and logging. 
 
In the next unit, you'll start working on real world projects. This unit does contain several projects that you'll code up that are geared toward consolidating your knowledge of programming fundamentals in Python. Over the course of this unit, you'll write a Hot or Cold and a [Fizz Buzz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) program, and you'll refactor both of these as you learn about new Python basics.

**Goals**

*   Configure development environment 
*   Understand Python's data types, collections, control flow, functions, objects, file i/o, serialization, debugging, and logging in Python
*   Get experience breaking down a process into an executable set of instructions
