#  Introduction to argparse

So far you have seen how to make simple command line interfaces for applications using `raw_input()` and `sys.argv` to obtain command line arguments. When you want to build more complex interfaces (think of the myriad options you can pass to the `git` command, for example), using `sys.argv` quickly becomes clunky.

In this assignment you will learn about a nicer way to handle more complex interfaces using the `argparse` module. This will give you a robust way of building command line interfaces moving forward, and we'll use argparse later in this lesson when we build our command line code snippets app.

Read through [this tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2.7/howto/argparse.html) to find out how to specify and use command line interfaces using argparse.

## Comprehension Check

1. How do you create an argument parser?
2. How do you find out the command line arguments an app using argparse takes?
3. What is the difference between a positional and an optional argument?
3. How would you add an optional argument for receiving an integer?
4. What does the `action` parameter of `add_argument` do?
5. How do you add a default value for an argument?
