# Adding a retrieval command to the snippets app

In the previous assignment we started to create a more complex command line application using the `argparse` and `csv` libraries.  Now it's your turn to try to extend the application so it can retrieve snippets as well as store them.

When you have completed the assignment you should be able to do something like this:

```console
# Store a snippet
python snippets.py put spam eggs

# Retrieve the snippet
python snippets.py get spam

# Store a snippet in a different file
python snippets.py put "list comprehension" "[item for item in items]" python-notes.csv

# Retrieve the snippet from the file
python snippets.py get "list comprehension" python-notes.csv

# Retrieve a snippet which hasn't been stored yet.  This should print an error
# message describing the problem
python snippets.py get nonexistant
```

Here are a few hints which might help you on the way:

* Try to follow the process we worked through in the previous assignment
* Use a second subparser for the get command
* Think about how you can best handle the error when the user tries to retrieve a snippet which hasn't been created yet

## Extension tasks

Try adding a search command which will look through your snippets and find the ones which contain a certain string.

Try adding an update command or modifying the put command to allow you to update an existing snippet.
