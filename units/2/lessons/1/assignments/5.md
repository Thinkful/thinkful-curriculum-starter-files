name: Adding a retrieval command to the snippets app
 -->
In the previous assignment we started to create a more complex command line application using the `argparse` and `csv` libraries. Now it's your turn to extend the application so it can retrieve snippets as well as store them. You can either continue to work from your existing code, or use [this version of the code](https://gist.github.com/oampo/2e450ecc138a2a7dee55) as a starting point for the assignment.

When you have completed the assignment you should be able to do something like this:

```bash
# Store a snippet
python snippets.py put spam eggs

# Retrieve the snippet
python snippets.py get spam

# Store a snippet in a different file
python snippets.py put "list comprehension" "[item for item in items]" python-notes.csv

# Retrieve the snippet from the file
python snippets.py get "list comprehension" python-notes.csv

# Retrieve a snippet which hasn't been stored yet.  This should print an error
# message describing the problem
python snippets.py get nonexistent  
```

Here are a few hints which might help you on the way:

* Try to follow the process we worked through in the previous assignment
* Use a second subparser for the get command
* Think about how you can best handle the error when the user tries to retrieve a snippet that hasn't been created yet

And as usual, be sure to use version control along the way!

# Project Completion

When you've completed this project, be sure to push your work up to a remote Github repo, and email a link to your mentor. Plan on discussing your code at your next mentor session.

# Optional Extension tasks

* Add a search command that looks through your snippets and find the ones containing a certain string.
* Add an update command or modify the put command to allow you to update an existing snippet.
