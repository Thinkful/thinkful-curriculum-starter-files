In this lesson we'll explore making HTTP requests using the Python [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library. This will give you the ability to write programs that talk to third party APIs. We'll also learn how to authenticate with oAuth, which many data apis require. By the end of this lesson, you'll be writing Python code to interact with the Twitter API, pulling in tweets and user data.
