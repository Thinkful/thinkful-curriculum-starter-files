# Twitter Extension: Wrap the Twitter API

In this assignment you are going to extend our authentication code to make a full-blown Twitter client.  Take a look through the [API documentation](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1) and pick two or three of features that you would like to support, for example posting tweets or listing the users you follow.  Then try to expand the *tweetful.py* file to add:

* An argparse CLI interface to your client
* Functions which use the API to implement your features
* Code to hook up your interface to your functions

You can either work from your existing code from the previous assignment, or use the code in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/oampo/44793fc5ac3e1d2d2664) as a starting point.

As you work through the assignment try to follow a few pieces of best practice:

- Sketch out your interface before you start coding it
- Think about how to arrange your code so it is simple to understand
- Remember to commit your code early and often
- Document your code as you go

When the project is complete, don't forget to push your code up to GitHub and discuss it with your mentor.

## Optional extension task

Try creating a simple client or tool for working with another OAuth API.
