 -->

One of the easiest ways to make HTTP requests in Python is using the **Requests** library.  It describes iteself as "an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings".

To help you get started using Requests, read through [this quickstart guide](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/) which shows you how to construct and carry out HTTP requests and work with the response data.

1. How do you make a GET request using the requests library?
2. What type of variable should the `params` argument to a request be passed, and what does the library do with this data?

4. Which argument do you use to send POST data along with a request?
