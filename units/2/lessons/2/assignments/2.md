# Making HTTP Requests in Python using Requests

One of the easiest ways to make HTTP requests and work with the responses in Python is using the **Requests** library.  It describes iteself as "an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings".

To help you get started using Requests, read through [this quickstart guide](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/) which covers a range of options for making HTTP requests.

1. How do you make a GET request using the requests library?
2. What type of variable should the `params` argument to a request be passed, and what does the library do with this data?
3. How do you obtain the content of an HTTP response?
4. Which argument do you use to send POST data along with a request?
5. How do you alter the headers which are sent to the server?
