## Course Objective

In this class you will learn the core skills required to program professionally using Python. You'll learn how to work with spreadsheets, REST APIs, databases, and the Flask web framework. You'll also learn about test driven development (TDD), which is an approach to writing software that can produce more reliable, maintainable code. By the end of this course, you'll have a portfolio of completed projects that demonstrate the skills you've learned, and the know how to use Python in professional settings.


## Learning Paths

The skills taught in this course support several learning paths. For individuals looking to automate administrative tasks and build simple tools, this course alone may provide all the technical training required. Similarly, if you're already an experienced progrmamer, and are taking this course just to pick up an additional language, this course alone may get you to your goal.

Other students will be on longer term learning paths, as they seek to change careers. Below we discuss some of the specific roles this course could play a role in preparing the student for.  

*   **Full Stack Web Developer:** Full stack web developers are responsible for writing both frontend and backend code. To be a successful full stack developer, you need a mastery of HTML, CSS, Javascript, at least one server side language like Python, and you need to know how to work with databases. Increasingly, you also need experience with at least one client side MVC framework, such as Angular or Ember.js. Someone who has mastered all of these skills would be well suited for a junior or mid-level full-stack developer job, depending on experience. 

*   **Data Science and Finance:** With a clean, easy syntax and powerful libraries like NumPy and Pandas for performant scientific computing, Python is the most popular scripting language in fields that require extensive data analysis. This course will give you a solid background in scripting, working with spreadsheets and databases, and doing some basic data analysis. For students seeking to become data scientists or work in finance, the next steps would be: 
    *   mastering domain specific knowledge  
    *   learning [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/), and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) 
    *   creating a portfolio of domain-themed projects


## Technologies Covered

*   Python 2.7
*   SQLite
*   SQL
*   PostgreSQL
*   SQL Alchemy
*   Flask
*   Heroku

## Prerequisites

*   Comfortable with HTML and CSS. 
*   Comfortable working with the command line
*   Experience using Git and Github for revision control

In the first lesson in this course, we provide resources for reviewing these prerequisites, if you need a refresher.


## Setup Checklist

*   **Get a Text Editor:** If you already have a preferred text editor,  keep using it. If you don’t, we recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). It’s lightweight, Mac and PC compatible, and free to download (though eventually you’ll want to buy a license to stop the occasional pop-up prompt).

*   **Install and Configure Git:** If you don't already have Git installed and configured on the computer you'll be working on, do that now. If you don't already have a Github account, you should create one.

*   **Join StackOverflow:** As a developer, you will spend a lot of time looking up how to implement a feature or fix a bug. One of the key skills you’ll be learning during the course is how to efficiently find information. While Google searches can yield great information, the go-to hub for developers is [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).
