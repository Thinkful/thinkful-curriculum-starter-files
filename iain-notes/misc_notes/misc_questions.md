- Is it worth introducing sqlite? personally I think so, if only because it's
  used in so many example tutorials

- should find out from SQLAlchemy list whether we should by demonstrating
  both declarative base and classical data mapper

- should we cover Alembic?

- can we do any kind of partnership with other people? Partnering with Zed Shaw to
  use SQL the hard way would be ideal
