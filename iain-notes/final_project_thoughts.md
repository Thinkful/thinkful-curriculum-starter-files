Unit 3 Final Project Brainstorming
==================================

Final Deliverable ideas
-----------------------
- no web interface
- user ought to be able to run the script either inputing interactively
  or through command line args, excuting some kind of query
- user ought to be able to add data to the database over CLI somehow
- user should be able to download a CSV file from the database,
  that is a result of filtering some how


Possible topics
---------------
- Pet database of some kind?? Make our own 


Elements To Be Covered
----------------------

- use requests to get data from a public database somehow,
  massage into our object schema, and persist with SQLAlchemy


Misc thoughts:
- could the project be to create a list of adoptable pets?
- user could be filtering on breed, weight, location, age
- could input information by downloading info with screen scrapers from 
  some public pet adoption databases


Possible database:
http://bcspcapets.shelterbuddy.com/search
- can we find one as good that is not BC specific?
- Petfinder is good but is a for-profit organization, may or may not be something Ben
  wants us involved with
