Notes on the SA tutorial:

Sections:
- what is an orm and why use one - DRAFT

- setting up SQLAlchemy
  - engine, metadata, concept of data mapper, unit of work
  - the metadata registry, on Base.metadata
  - the concept of the identity map  


Questions:
- have they used logging and pdb yet??
 
Cover rolling back

TO DO:
- walk through the whole tutorial using sqllite

Installing sqlite on all platforms:
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_installation.htm

- write introduction to SQLlite
  - cover installing on all platforms
  - connecting sqllite with python\
  - how to make a database, list tables, describe tables;
  .tables lists tables
  .schema {tablename} describes table
  .help lists commands
  pragma table_info( {tablename} );
- tip for folks that you can't end the . commands wth a semi-colon  
- covering making a database 
- after reading my piece, they should go read
  http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite.html

write content piece Introduction to Relational Databases, 
Sqllite. and Postgres.

Put this somewhere later:

Normally we can set up the engine and Base class and just forget about them, however
when things aren't working it's very helpful to understand which component is doing what for 
debugging and making sense of the SQLAlchemy stack traces (the error output in the console).
A common error is getting the creation of the different components out of order when refactoring
a single file application into multiple files. It helps to remember the following:

    * when a module is imported, all its code runs
    * we need to create the Base class before defining data model classes
    * we need to create the engine before any calls to metadata methods

If you are having issues sorting out what runs when, use the log to see the order
of execution in your terminal.


TODO: 
- write the intro to SQL the hard way
- figure out what the assigned extensions will be
  for it
- figure out what the end result database should be
  by the end of that for transition to the postgres 
  assignment

- postgres content: how to read documentation
  and work through the official postgresql manual
- chart out the postgres assignment
  what are the input and output csv files going to look like


Content writing:
- Unit Overview: DONE DRAFT
- SQLlite Intro: DONE, I think this can be an assignment?
- SQL The Hard Way: 
  - write the intro, include which exercises we want them to do
  - write the extension assignment for it

- POSTGRESQL:
  - write the intro, guide to reading online documentation
  - figure out the assignment

- SQLA:
  - DONE   
  - write the domain model content, with todo
  - write the querying content, with todo
  - write the final assignment check list
