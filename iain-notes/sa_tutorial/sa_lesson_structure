Questions for Ben:
- have the students done command line arg parsing, and if so, how?
  - YES 
- what should we use for database connection string in the code along?
  - YES
- should I roll all the content forinto one markdown file? 
- how do I type up a code along??


Assingment 1:
    - read the contents for sa_tutorial.rst, what_is_an_orm, important_concepts.rst
    - these can be rolled into one markdown file I think?
    - nothing for students to do except read, is this ok?
    - add some comprehension questions for the document 

Assignment 2: - the first code along  
    - code along example:   http://www.thinkful.com/courses/FEWD-001/unit/2/lesson/3/assignment/4
    - I think remove the querying except for getting 
      one object and updating it. for now
    - encourage the student to stop the program and look
      at the console
    - in the write up, introduce to new types:
      int, date, time, datetime, decimal, boolean,  
    - assignments to extend the program:
      - allow passing in a database connection string as a command line arg
      - allow passing in a command line arg that turns on or off DB initialization
      - get it working with postgres and have a psql terminal open to the
        database at the same time
      - verify in your psql terminal that persists are happening when you expect them
      - add the Pet domain model and shelter domain model classes with their
        respective foreign keys 
        there should be a relationship on pet  
      - alter the program main body to insert some pets and a couple of shelters
      - questions, should backrefs be covered in here?

        
Assingment 3 - Domain Model Relationships
    - write the next content on extending domain model
        - cover many to many relationships
        - cover hierarchal relationships
        - introduce an association object
    - extend our program with the following:
        - add the person model and the pets person relationship
        - change the pet person relationship to an association, add how long
          the person and pet have been together
        - insert some data 
        - alter the pet relationship mapper so that a person.pets gives us 
          a list of pets ordered by how long we've had them
        - add an fkey 'parent' to the Pet model pointing to the pet table
          - get the relationships "children" and "parent" working on pet
        - insert some data with pets that have parents
        - do the same for the person table


Assingment 4 - Querying
    - write the tutorial on querying, have them head off to the SQLA docs on querying
       - cover different filters
       - joins, joins with specific clause specifying joins
       - likes, and, or
    - have the student read the SQLA docs on querying
    - illustrate an example of searching by keywords with dynamic generation
      of queries
    - exercises:
      - add some queries to your app

Assingment 5:
    - create the CVS file for our domain model
    - have them write a script from scratch that uses the csv file
      to populate a model 
    - command line arg to search for Pet from keywords:
    - name:titchy age:4 breed.name:cat
