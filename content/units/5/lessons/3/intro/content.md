In this first lesson, we'll get SQLite up and running. SQLite is a lightweight and easy to configure database suitable for developing web apps. We'll learn how to use the command line interface to interact with SQLite databases, and create a small  sample database of pets, people, and pet shelters. We'll work with this database to learn the fundamentals of [SQL (structured query language)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL): creating tables, inserting records, modifying and deleting them, and querying them.

Keep in mind that the goal here is **not** to teach you everything about SQL. You could spend an entire course focusing only on relational databases. Instead, the goal is to teach you enough about SQL that you'll have a sense of what's happening "behind the scenes" later in this course when we begin to use SQLAlchemy as an abstraction layer over our databases. 

###### The assignments in this lesson are cumulative, in that the state of your database in one assignment is the starting point for the next one. Although we encourage you to code along so that your database is in the "right" state at the end of each assignment, we have also including "starting points" for some assignments. These starting points are SQL scripts you can run to generate a database that is in the right state to start an assignment.
