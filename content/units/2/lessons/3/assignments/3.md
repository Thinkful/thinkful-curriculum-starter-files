In the previous assignment you looked at what unit testing is and what benefits it brings to developers.  Now it's time to learn about how unit testing in Python works and how to write simple test cases.

We will be using a built-in Python module called `unittest` which is designed to help you write and run tests on your code.  To help you get started with the `unittest` module, read through the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html).  Pay particular attention to the basic example, which demonstrates the key structures and methods which we will be using to write tests.
