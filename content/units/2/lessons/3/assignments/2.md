# Introduction to unit testing

So far when we have been writing code any testing that we done has been manual;  we have run our code with some input and seen what the result is.  As our code starts to grow more complex this will soon become less practical, and so we need to find ways to make our testing more automated and more thorough.  The most common style of software testing is *unit testing*.  In unit testing we check that small sections of our code (known as *units* are operating as we expect).

To help you start to understand a bit more about what unit testing is and why we do it, read [this introduction to unit testing](http://soundsoftware.ac.uk/unit-testing-why-bother).
