1. How do you open a file in Python in read only mode? How do you open a file in write mode?
2. If you do `f = open('myfile.txt', 'r')`, will your variable f be a string?
3. How do you read a file that you’ve opened?
4. How do you write to a file object?
5. Why is it critical that you explicitly close your files, especially when you’re writing to one?
