One of the most common tasks in computing is working with of tabulated data.  You will almost certainly have experience with this through using spreadsheet programs such as Excel. 

In this assignment you will learn how to use Python to work with data in the CSV format. CSV is a simple text-based format which can be easily imported and exported by spreadsheet packages. Being able to read and write to CSV (which can easily be imported in Excel) means you can get data from and give data to non-technical colleagues and clients.

Carefully read through [this tutorial](http://java.dzone.com/articles/python-101-reading-and-writing) on reading and writing CSV files using the `csv` module. We'll use this knowledge in the next two assignments to build our code snippet app.

# Comprehension Check

2. How do you iterate over rows when reading a csv file?
3. How do you write a row to a csv file?
4. What is the difference between the `reader`/`writer` and `DictReader`/`DictWriter` objects?
5. What does the `fieldnames` parameter represent in the `DictReader` and `DictWriter` constructor?
6. How would you write a header line to a CSV file?
