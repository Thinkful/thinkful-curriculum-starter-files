Files are fundamental to the way we use computers, allowing us to store and access data in a simple consistent way. It seems like it would be pretty handy to be able to work with files in Python then right? In this assignment you'll learn how to read and write to files in your Python programs, and then later in this lesson, we'll use this knowledge to build our code snippets app.

Work through [these exercises in Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-intermediate-en-OGNHh/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096) to learn how to read and write files in Python.

# Comprehension Check

1. How do you open a file in Python in read only mode? How do you open a file in write mode?
2. If you do `f = open('myfile.txt', 'r')`, will your variable f be a string?
3. How do you read a file that you’ve opened?
4. How do you write to a file object?
5. Why is it critical that you explicitly close your files, especially when you’re writing to one?
6. How can you use `with` and `as` to open a file and assign its contents to a variable, in order to avoid having to explicitly close the file object?
7. What does it mean when we say that the data in a file object is *buffered*?
