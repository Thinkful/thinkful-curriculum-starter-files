In this lesson you'll learn how to use Python to read and write data to and from spreadsheets. No matter what you end up doing as a programmer, it's good to be able to work with spreadsheets because they are a data format that most people can work with. Over the course of this lesson we'll build a command line utility for saving code snippets to a CSV file as a study aid. This will give us a chance to learn how to get arguments from the command line when you run a script, how to open and close files, and how to work with the Python csv library.

# Goals
