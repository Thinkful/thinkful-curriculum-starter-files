In the first unit of this course, we quickly ramped up on programming fundamentals in Python. Although there were several code along and code from scratch projects you created in that unit, they probably didn't feel much like "real world" projects. This was out of necessity: in order to use programming to tackle real world problems, you first need to reach a minimum level of competency with the syntax and fundamentals of a language. 

In this unit, you'll start to see the payoff of the hard work you put in Unit 1 as we begin to use Python to write applications with more complex functionality that address problems you might face as a professional programmer. Although you'll learn new syntax and how to work with new Python libraries, our focus will increasingly be on assessing different strategies for solving a problem using software. 

The overall goal of this Unit is to give you your first taste of using Python to solve practical problems. Over the course of this unit you'll learn how to read and write data from spreadsheets. You'll also learn how to use Python to get data from third party APIs (which you can in turn supply to end users in spreadsheets). Finally, we'll introduce the idea of software testing, which is a must have for professional programmers and which allows you to write more maintainable software.

# Goals

*   Gain experience writing software that solves real world problems
*   Learn how to read and write to spreadsheets
*   Learn how to get data from APIs, manipulate it, and make it available to end users.
*   Learn what software testing is, why you should use it, and how to do it in Python
