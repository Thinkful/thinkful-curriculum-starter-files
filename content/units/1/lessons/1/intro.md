In this lesson, we'll review the prerequisites you need to succeed in this course: HTML, CSS, Git/Github and command line basics. You'll complete a simple coding challenge that demonstrates your mastery of these requirements, and then we'll go on to learn about the high level goals and characterstics of the Python language, and do some drills to practice basic syntax for strings, numbers, and datetime objects.

The goal of this unit is to get you back into the programming mindset if you're not already there, and to ensure prerequisite knowledge that you need to have to succeed in this course. If you have made it through this unit by your start date, you'll be able to hit the ground running and rapidly make progress.

# Goals
