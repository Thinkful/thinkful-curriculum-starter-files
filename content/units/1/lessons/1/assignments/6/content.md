We're at the end of the warmup material for this course. To close things out, we're going to work through some simple exercises over at Codecademy that will teach you the basics of working with variables, booleans, numbers, strings, and datetime objects.

# Python Syntax 

Work through this set of exercises on [Python syntax basics](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-python-6WeG3/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096). You'll learn about some of Python's basic data types, arithmetic operations, commenting and indenting code, and variable assignment. The ideas you'll learn here are simple, but they are building blocks of all programs.

# Working with Strings

Much of the programming you do in Python will require working with strings. Work through these [exercises on strings](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-sRXwR/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096) from Codecademy, which will introduce some of the methods shared by all string objects.

# Datetime Objects

One of Python's more convenient built in objects is the datetime object. In [this set of exercises](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-en-zFPOx/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096), you'll learn how to work with dates and times in Python.
