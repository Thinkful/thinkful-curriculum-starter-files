Just reading about lists and dictionaries isn't going to ensure you master them. Let's get some practice with the syntax for lists and dictionaries and see how we can use them. 

Work through [this set of exercises from Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-en-pwmb1/0/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096). To be clear, you should work through all 14 exercises. Also, be aware that you'll see some conditional syntax that looks like this:

```python
if 1 < 2:
    print "do something"
```

Fortunately, Python is human readable, so you probably already guessed that `print do something` would print here because 1 is indeed less than 2. You'll also encounter *for loops* which allow you to iterate over each item in a list and do something with it. We'll cover both conditionals and loops in more depth when we get to the lesson on control flow later in this unit.
