Before we start learning about the details of different parts of the Python programming language, there are some higher level characteristics of the language that are good to understand. For this, we'd like you to read through the [General Introduction](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/GeneralIntro/introduction.html) to the *How to Think Like a Computer Scientist* online course.

This text will explain the difference between high- and low-level, and compiled and interpreted programming languages. You'll also learn about the two modes Python can be run in: the interactive console and program mode.
