The final kind of control flow we'll discuss in this lesson is exception handling. Exception handling allows us to write code that handles [edge cases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case) that cause errors when our program executes. 

Most Python programs of any degree of complexity feature exception handling at one point or another, so it's an important part of the language to understand and know how to effectively use. 

Read through this[tutorial on exception handling in Python](http://www.python-course.eu/exception_handling.php), and as you work through it, keep a Python terminal open and try out the examples for yourself.
