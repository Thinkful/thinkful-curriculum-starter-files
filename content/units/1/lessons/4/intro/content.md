This lesson is all about control flow. Control flow has to do with the different ways we can control the order that instructions get completed in a program. In this lesson, we’ll learn how to use conditionals and loops to achieve control flow. We'll also learn how to use try/except/finally blocks to control how our program responds in the case of errors. With these simple constructs, you can write programs of considerable complexity.

Like in the previous lesson, we’re still learning the basic building blocks. The real pay off will come in Units 2 through 5 where we use these tools to build practical applications. That being said, at the end of this lesson, you’ll build a [FizzBuzz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) program from scratch. Building this simple app will bring together much of what you will have learned so far about strings, numbers, conditionals, and loops. 

Fizzbuzz may seem like a pointless app on the surface, but its a common interview question for technical positions and is an effective way to assess a candidate's grasp of programming fundamentals (and [apparently](http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/) many candidates **can't** impelement it!).

# Goals

- Understand the concept of control flow.
- Know how to use the following Python keywords: `if`, `else`, `elif`, `while`, `for`, `try`, `except`, `finally`.
- Learn how to use .raw_input() to get user inputs from the command line and how you can make your Python scripts executable from the command line.
