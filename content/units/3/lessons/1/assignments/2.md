To learn SQL fundamentals, over the next three assignments, we're going to work through sections of the online book *[Learn SQL The Hard Way](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/)* (which we'll refer to from now on as *LSQLTHW*) by Zed Shaw, the author of *Learn Python the Hard Way*. 

*LSQLTHW* is an unfinished book, but it teaches the topics we'll need in this course. We'll work up through exercise 15. The exercises in *LSQLTHW* are all fairly short, and include examples using an SQLite database.
You should code along with the examples and make sure you get everything working in your own SQLite database. The exercises in *LSQLTHW* also contain extra credit suggestions. It is not necessary to complete these. However, if you do choose to work through them, do so in an alternate copy of your database so that the primary database stays in sync withour lesson plan (we'll be working with the same db over several assignments).

In the first part of our SQL crash course, we're going to learn how to create tables, how to insert rows (also known as records) into a table, and how to create records that reference other records. 

Please work through the following exercises in *LSQLTHW*:

*   [Exercise 0: The Setup](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex0.html)
*   [Exercise 1: Creating Tables](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex1.html)
*   [Exercise 2: Creating A Multi-Table Database](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex2.html)
*   [Exercise 3: Inserting Data](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex3.html)
*   [Exercise 4: Insert Referential Data](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex4.html)
