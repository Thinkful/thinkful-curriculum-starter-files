In Part 2 of our SQL crash course, we're going to learn how to **select**, **delete**, and **update** rows in our tables according to given criteria. In these exercises, pay special attention to how we can conditionally select records based on criteria. Also, pay attention to how we can query across multiple tables, and how we can use **subequeries**.

Please work through the following exercises in *LSQLTHW*:

*   [Exercise 5: Selecting Data](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex5.html)
*   [Exercise 6: Select Across Many Tables](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex6.html)
