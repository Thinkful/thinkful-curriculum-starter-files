In the final installment of our SQL crash course, we're going to learn about **altering tables**, database **transactions** and data **modeling**.

###### In this assignment, you'll learn the syntax for adding new columns to an existing table. You'll also learn the syntax for dropping a table from a database. You will **not**, however, learn how to drop columns from a table. This is because SQLite does not support dropping columns. More robust RDMS like PostgreSQL and its peers support dropping columns, and we'll explore this later in this unit.

Please work through the following exercises in *LSQLTHW*:

*   [Exercise 12: Destroying And Altering Tables](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex12.html)
*   [Exercise 14: Basic Transactions](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex14.html)
*   [Exercise 15: Data Modeling](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex15.html)
