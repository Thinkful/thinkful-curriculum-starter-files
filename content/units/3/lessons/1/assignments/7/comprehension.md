1. What is a foreign key constraint?
2. What is a cascade?
3. What do you think *should* happen (or be prevented) if we attempt the following on our pets database:
    *  deleting a species?
    *  deleting a shelter?
    *  deleting a person?
4. How is the foreign key relationship for pet to pet shelter different than from the one from pet to breed? What would we need to specify to make this clear?
